Create a program that will ask the user to input a string.

1. Check if the input **string** is longer than 1 character.
    * If the string is not greater than one, show an exit message and exit the program using the `exit()` function.
2. Then ask the user to enter a single **character**.
    * If the input is more than a single **character**, show a error message and exit the program.
3. Check if the **character** from step 2 is present in the string from step 1.
   * If not show the message accordingly
4. If the string is present, show the position at which the **character** is first found inside the **string**.

Example:

```
character> a
string> Marius

"a" is character nr 2 in Marius 
```
