## Exercise 1:

Write a program that prompts the user to enter three numbers and prints the largest number among them.

## Exercise 2:

Write a program that takes a string as input and prints the string in reverse order.

## Exercise 3:

Write a program that prompts the user to enter a number and prints all the even numbers from 1 to that number.

## Exercise 4:

Write a program that takes a positive integer as input and prints the sum of all the numbers from 1 to that integer.

## Exercise 5:

Write a program that prompts the user to enter a positive integer and prints a triangle pattern using asterisks. For
example, if the user enters 5, the program should print:

```
*
**
***
****
*****
```

## Exercise 6

Write a program that generates random numbers between 1 and 10 using a while loop. The program should continue
generating numbers until it generates a number greater than 8. Once the number is greater than 8, the program should
terminate the loop using the break statement.

## Exercise 7

Write a program that takes a list of numbers as input. The program should calculate the product of all the numbers in
the list. However, if the product exceeds 100, the program should stop calculating and print a message indicating that
the product is too large. Use a for loop and the break statement to terminate the loop when necessary.

## Exercise 8

Write a program that prompts the user to enter a string and checks if it is a palindrome (i.e., if it reads the same
forwards and backwards).
