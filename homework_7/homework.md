**Once upon a time, in the city of Codeburg:**

1. **Introduction to Dictionaries:**
    - You decide to create a profile for a person named John. This profile includes information like his name, age,
      gender, and city.

2. **Exploring the Profile:**
    - After creating the profile, you want to explore the details. Learn how to access and print specific information
      from the profile, such as John's name and age.

3. **Adding and Modifying Details:**
    - As you get to know John better, you decide to add more information to his profile. You include his occupation and
      make adjustments to his age.
    - You can add information or change information in dicts by assigning values:

```python
some_dict = {'key1': 'value1'}
some_dict['key2'] = 'value2'  # Adds a new key (key2)
some_dict['key1'] = 'other_value1'  # Modifies key1 to have value -> other_value1
```

4. **Taking Inventory:**
    - To keep track of all the details, you decide to loop through the profile and print each key-value pair.
    - Hint: Use `.items()`

5. **Checking for Specifics:**
    - Curious about a particular detail, you check if John's profile contains information about his gender.
    - Hint: You can check if a dict has a specific key using the `in` keyword example: `if 'key' in my_dict:`

6. **Removing Unnecessary Details:**
    - Realizing that you have the city's information already, you decide to remove it from John's profile.
    - Hint: Remember the `.pop()` method.

7. **Building a Phonebook:**
    - Inspired by the idea of profiles, you decide to create a simple phonebook for the residents of Codeburg. Learn how
      to add, look up, and delete contacts.

8. **Analyzing Text:**
    - As a side project, you decide to analyze the frequency of letters in a message you received. Create a dictionary
      to store the count of each letter in the message.
