""" Create 2 variables, x and y, whose values are read from the keyboard.

Use the int() function to convert the input values into integers.

* Next, define the variable "sum" which will be equal to the sum of x and y.
* Define the variable "diff" which will be equal to x - y (the difference between x and y).
* Define the variable "remainder" which will be equal to the remainder of dividing x by y.
* Define the variable "mult" which will be equal to x multiplied by y.
* Define the variable "power3" which will be equal to x raised to the power of 3.

Display all the results.
